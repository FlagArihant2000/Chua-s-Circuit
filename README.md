# Chua-s-Circuit
Chaos Theory is a branch in mathematics, which deals with dynamic systems, involving a highly sensitive reaction of the output given a slight change of the input. Here, this is demonstrated using a well known circuit known as Chua's Circuit. Basically, it is a nonperiodic oscillator, that it, it produces an output waveform that never repeats. It is also known as the "paradigm of chaos". This was done as a project for Electronic Devices and Circuits course at VNIT Nagpur during my third semester. The implementation was done by replacing the Chua's Diode using transistors. The simulation is done on NI Multisim version 14.
